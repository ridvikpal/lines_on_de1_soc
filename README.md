# lines_on_de1_soc
Working code for ECE243 Lab 5 (Winter 2023) at the University of Toronto. The goal is to draw graphics (lines) on a VGA connected display on the DE1-SoC computer using the ARMv7 processor. All code is written in C and debugged in ARM Assembly.

Part 1 draws static lines on the display. Part 2 draws an animated moving bar on the display. Part 3 draws an animation of 8 lines moving randomly and bouncing off the sides of the display

Need to comment code to make it more readable
